                <h3>Philosophical</h3>
                <p>A thoughtful philosopher outside of the college. That's the main reason why I called myself as
                    Socartez. I'm not a fan of abstruse terminologies or unpractical focuses.</p>
                <h3>Freestyle</h3>
                <p>The student who always has various kinds of interests in the world, as a result of that, I'm always
                    suffer from decidophobia. Sometimes I just behave like a quitter, because I do not have much
                    enthusiasm last long on the same thing. </p>
                <h3>Satirical</h3>
                <p>A strange joker searching for laughter only for my self.Because the whole world is full of
                    unreasonable things, I would like to analyze them and enjoy the absurdity.</p>
